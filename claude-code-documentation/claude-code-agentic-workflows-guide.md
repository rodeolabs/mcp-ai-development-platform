## Overview

Claude Code's agentic workflow system enables developers to create specialized, autonomous AI assistants that handle complex, repeatable tasks with minimal human intervention. This system revolutionizes development workflows by providing:

- **Specialized Sub-Agents**: Purpose-built AI assistants for specific tasks
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents working concurrently
- **Workflow Automation**: Complex task chains with intelligent routing
- **Context Isolation**: Independent contexts preventing cross-contamination
- **Tool Integration**: Granular permissions and MCP server access

### Key Principles
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each agent handles one specific domain
2. **Assembly Line Efficiency**: Sequential and parallel task execution
3. **Context Awareness**: Intelligent routing based on task analysis
4. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Strategic human oversight for quality assurance
5. **Modularity**: Reusable, composable agent components

## Sub-Agent Architecture

### Core Components
```
Claude Code Core
├── Main Chat Interface
├── Sub-Agent Orchestrator
├── Context Manager
├── Tool Permission System
└── MCP Integration Layer
```

### Agent Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: Define agent role and capabilities
2. **Configuration**: Set tools, model, and permissions
3. **Registration**: Store in `.claude/agents/` directory
4. **Invocation**: Automatic or explicit activation
5. **Execution**: Task processing with isolated context
6. **Reporting**: Results and handoff to next agent or human

### Context Isolation Benefits
- **Prevents Bloat**: Each agent maintains focused context
- **Reduces Hallucinations**: Specialized knowledge domains
- **Improves Performance**: Faster processing with relevant context
- **Enables Parallelism**: Independent concurrent execution

## Invocation and Workflow Integration

### Automatic Delegation Patterns

#### Context-Based Routing
```
User Request: "Review the login page design and check for accessibility issues"
↓
System Analysis: UI/UX + Accessibility keywords detected
↓
Auto-Route: @design-review agent invoked
```

#### Domain Expertise Mapping
```
Code Changes Detected → @code-reviewer
Security Concerns → @security-scanner  
Performance Issues → @performance-optimizer
UI/UX Tasks → @design-review
Documentation Needs → @documentation-writer
```

#### Workflow Pattern Recognition
```
Pull Request Created → Parallel Invocation:
├── @code-reviewer (code quality)
├── @security-scanner (vulnerability check)
├── @test-runner (automated testing)
└── @performance-auditor (performance impact)
```

### Explicit Invocation Methods

#### Direct Agent Calling
```bash
# In main chat
@agent-design-review
@agent-security-scanner
@agent-performance-optimizer

# With specific context
@agent-code-reviewer please review the authentication logic in auth.js

# Multiple agents for complex tasks
@agent-frontend-specialist @agent-backend-architect
```

#### Command-Based Invocation
```bash
# Manage agents
/agents list
/agents create new-agent
/agents edit existing-agent
/agents delete old-agent

# Agent-specific commands
/security-scan
/performance-audit
/design-review
```

#### Natural Language Delegation
```
"I need someone to review the security of our payment processing"
→ Auto-routes to @security-reviewer

"Can you check if our new design is accessible?"
→ Auto-routes to @design-review

"Help me optimize the database queries"
→ Auto-routes to @performance-optimizer
```

### Workflow Chain Examples

#### Sequential Workflow
```
1. User Request: "Implement user authentication"
2. @backend-architect: Design system architecture
3. @security-reviewer: Validate security approach  
4. @code-reviewer: Review implementation
5. @test-automator: Create comprehensive tests
6. @documentation-writer: Generate documentation
```

#### Parallel Workflow  
```
User Request: "Prepare for production deployment"
├── @security-scanner: Security audit
├── @performance-optimizer: Performance check
├── @test-runner: Full test suite
├── @documentation-writer: Update docs
└── @infrastructure-agent: Deployment prep
```

#### Iterative Workflow
```
Design Phase:
@design-review → Feedback → @frontend-specialist → Implementation → @design-review → Validation
```

## Advanced Workflow Patterns

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

#### Assembly Line Pattern
```
Input → Agent A → Agent B → Agent C → Output
```
Example: Code → Security Review → Performance Audit → Documentation → Release

#### Star Pattern (Hub and Spoke)
```
        Agent B
           ↑
Orchestrator ← Agent A
           ↓
        Agent C
```
Example: Project Manager Agent coordinating Frontend, Backend, and Testing Agents

#### Pipeline Pattern
```
Stage 1: [Agent A, Agent B] (Parallel)
   ↓
Stage 2: [Agent C] (Sequential)
   ↓  
Stage 3: [Agent D, Agent E] (Parallel)
```
Example: Analysis → Implementation → Validation phases

### Conditional Workflows

#### Decision Tree Pattern
```
if (security_critical) {
    invoke(@security-reviewer)
    if (vulnerabilities_found) {
        invoke(@security-patcher)
        invoke(@penetration-tester)
    }
}
```

#### Quality Gate Pattern
```
Code Changes → @code-reviewer
if (quality_score < 80) {
    invoke(@code-refactorer)
    retry(@code-reviewer)
}
if (approved) {
    invoke(@test-runner)
    if (tests_pass) {
        invoke(@deployment-agent)
    }
}
```

### Advanced Tool Integration

#### MCP Server Orchestration
```yaml
# Agent with multiple MCP servers
tools: 
  - mcp_database: read, write, query
  - mcp_api_testing: test, validate, monitor
  - mcp_performance: analyze, benchmark, optimize
```

#### Cross-Platform Integration
```yaml
# Agent with external service access
integrations:
  - github: pull_requests, issues, reviews
  - slack: notifications, updates, alerts
  - jira: tickets, epics, sprints
  - aws: deployment, monitoring, logs
```

### Parallel Processing Strategies

#### Concurrent Agent Execution
```bash
# Multiple Claude Code instances
claude --agent backend-specialist &
claude --agent frontend-specialist &
claude --agent test-automator &
wait  # Wait for all to complete
```

#### Work Distribution
```
Large Task → Split into subtasks → Distribute to specialized agents → Combine results
```

#### Load Balancing
```
High-priority tasks → Fast agents (Haiku)
Complex analysis → Powerful agents (Opus)  
Routine work → Efficient agents (Sonnet)
```

## Troubleshooting and Optimization

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Agent Not Invoked
**Problem**: Agent not automatically selected for relevant tasks
**Solutions**:
1. **Improve Description**: Make routing criteria more specific
   ```yaml
   # Vague description
   description: helps with code
   
   # Specific description  
   description: React component optimization, prop validation, performance profiling
   ```

2. **Add Keywords**: Include trigger words in description
   ```yaml
   description: UI design validation, accessibility audit, WCAG compliance, visual testing
   triggers: ["design", "ui", "accessibility", "visual", "frontend"]
   ```

3. **Check Agent Priority**: Ensure proper priority settings
   ```yaml
   priority: high  # Increases selection probability
   ```

#### Poor Agent Performance
**Problem**: Agent produces inconsistent or low-quality results
**Solutions**:
1. **Refine System Prompt**: Add more specific instructions and examples
2. **Adjust Model Selection**: Use appropriate model for task complexity
3. **Restrict Tool Access**: Limit tools to prevent confusion
4. **Add Context Guidelines**: Provide clear context and constraints

#### Tool Access Issues
**Problem**: Agent cannot access required tools or resources
**Solutions**:
1. **Check Tool Permissions**: Verify tool list in YAML frontmatter
2. **Review MCP Configuration**: Ensure MCP servers are properly configured
3. **Validate Dependencies**: Check that required services are running
4. **Test Tool Access**: Manually verify tool functionality

#### Context Overflow
**Problem**: Agent context becomes too large, affecting performance
**Solutions**:
1. **Implement Context Pruning**: Remove irrelevant context periodically
2. **Use Focused Scope**: Limit agent to specific files or modules
3. **Enable Incremental Updates**: Preserve relevant context between sessions
4. **Set Context Limits**: Configure maximum context size per agent

### Performance Tuning
